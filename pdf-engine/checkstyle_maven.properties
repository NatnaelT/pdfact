# In checkstyle_config.xml, the path to the suppression filter file
# is declared as follows:
#
# <module name="SuppressionFilter">
#    <property name="file" value="${config_loc}/checkstyle_suppressions.xml"/>
# </module>
#
# The property "config_loc" is resolved automatically by the the checkstyle 
# eclipse plugin. But using maven, this property doesn't exist per default. So 
# we need to define it here.
